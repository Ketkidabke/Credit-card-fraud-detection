# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Load the dataset using the pandas module.
2. Perform missing value analysis on the dataset.
3. From the dataset, calculate the number of genuine transactions, number of
fraud transactions and the percentage of fraud transactions.
4. Using the visualization module, visualize the genuine and fraudulent
transactions using a bar graph.
5. Using the Standard Scaler module, normalize the amount column and
store the new values in the NormalizedAmount column.
6. Split the dataset in train and test set and have a 70:30 split ratio for the
model.
7. Now use a decision tree and random forest model for training on top of the
train set.
8. Compare the predictions of both models using predict().
9. Compare the accuracy of both models using score().
10. Check the performance matrix of both models and compare which
model is having the highest performance.
